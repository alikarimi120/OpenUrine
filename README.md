# 📊 Access to the OpenUrine Dataset

The **OpenUrine Dataset** is a comprehensive collection of urinary sediment microscopy images designed for automated detection and classification using deep learning techniques. This is the first publicly available dataset dedicated to urinary particle detection.

## Dataset Composition

The OpenUrine dataset comprises **6,430 high-resolution microscopic images** from multiple clinical laboratories:

- **790 labeled images** with expert annotations containing **31,285 bounding boxes** across **39 distinct particle categories**
- **5,640 unlabeled images** for self-supervised learning applications

### Particle Categories Include:

**Cells:** RBC, WBC, Epithelial cells (Squamous, Transitional, Renal), WBC Clumps, RBC Clumps, Lipid Casts

**Casts:** Hyaline, Granular, Waxy, Cellular (RBC, WBC), Broad, Fatty

**Crystals:** Calcium Oxalate, Triple Phosphate, Uric Acid, Amorphous, Cystine, Tyrosine, Leucine, Cholesterol, Bilirubin, and more

**Microorganisms:** Bacteria, Yeast, Fungal Hyphae, Parasites (*Trichomonas vaginalis*, *Schistosoma haematobium*, *Enterobius vermicularis*)

**Others:** Sperm, Mucus, Fat Droplets, Oval Fat Bodies

**Artifacts:** Foreign substances and imaging errors

This dataset supports the development and validation of deep learning models for comprehensive automated urinalysis, as described in the study:

**"A Multi-Head YOLOv12 with Self-Supervised Pretraining for Urinary Sediment Particle Detection"**
